<h1>15-740 Project: Virtual Application Profiler</h1>
Sven Stork, Anthony Gitter
<p>
Existing binary instrumentation tools can be useful for analyzing code performance and optimal hardware
structures for an application, but the slowdown from dynamic instrumentation can make the use of such
tools a tedious process. In addition, any programmer wishing to create custom dynamic analysis must first
learn to use an instrumentation library such as <a href="http://www.pintool.org/">Pin</a>.
<p>
We propose to implement a extensible framework for rapid prototyping and analysis of program behavior
on hardware structures. Our framework will first use Pin to instrument code and log a trace of a program's
execution, including information such as memory accesses, memory allocation, function calls, time, and symbol
names. The trace will be stored in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database. Based on this stored
information, the programmer
can quickly and easily perform different kinds of analysis without re-executing the Pin-instrumented code.
<p>
One of the main benefits of this approach is that all intermediate information is directly accessible via
SQL queries, which enables programmers to build custom types of high level analysis with ease. However,
analysis is not limited to what can be expressed as SQL queries, as we will use the database to retrieve
information for more complex use cases. Equally important is the fact that the instrumented code only
needs to be run once, because iteratively tweaking parameters and rerunning instrumented code can be a
very slow process.
