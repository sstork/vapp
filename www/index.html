<h1>15-740 Project: Virtual Application Profiler</h1>
Sven Stork, Anthony Gitter
<p>
As hardware grows more complex and with the transition
to multicore systems, it becomes increasingly important for
software developers to understand the interactions between
their software and the underlying architecture in order to
maximize performance and ensure correctness. We present
the Virtual Application Profiler, a replay and analysis tool
that facilitates this understanding by allowing programmers
to iteratively simulate application execution on many architecture
configurations and evaluate memory usage and protection
in parallel programs. Our profiler is unique in that it
logs all application execution traces in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database,
which allows developers to view and manipulate the logged
data with ease.

<a href="report.pdf">final report (PDF)</a> are now available.
