\section{Experimental Setup}
For our evaluation we used the latest version of the Pin tool
infrastructure available (i.e. pin-2.7-29972). Unless otherwise
specified, all example programs have been compiled with GCC compiler
version 4.4.1, enabling debug information and disabling any
optimizations. We used SQLite version 3.6.16 that was part of our
default Linux distribution.

The benchmarks have been run on an Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 CPU system
with 4GB of main memory, using the software packages described in the
previous paragraph.
