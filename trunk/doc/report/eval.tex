\section{Experimental Evaluation}
Compare with FDR, which claims 2\% slowdown in a typically scenario
and 34 MB log files (for 1 billion instruction replay window)
per processor in addition to a full memory dump.

Compare with BugNet, whose First Load Log grew to ~100 MB in the worst
case and less than 20 MB on average when using a window of 1
billion instructions.

Compare with Eraser.  Programs run 10 to 30 times slower with Eraser.

SIGMA does not report slowdown caused by instrumentation, but shows
that some of its logs can grow to hundreds of MB even \emph{after} compression.
However, in other cases a several hundred MB trace is compressed
to a less than 1 MB trace.

MemSpy results in 22 to 58 times slowdown during testing on a single processor.
